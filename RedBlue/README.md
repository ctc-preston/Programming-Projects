About: This is a neural network model trained through evolution to categorize non-linear data to 1 of 2 groups, finds the relation between 2 inputs and their corresponding groups.

How to run: To run the runnable jar file, it must be run through the command line with java installed. Alternatively, you can download and run the java files on your own java compiler.

What happens when running: When running the program, it will initially start training the neural network using predetermined parameters. It displays the average cost function for the last 10% of generations out of the total amount of generations. The lower the cost function is the better the program is at classifying the non-linear data and should approch 0.

How is classification determined: The neural network is given 2 inputs and returns 2 outputs. The 2 inputs are numbers from 1-9. if the inputs are the numbers 1-6 and 4-9 respectivly it is catagorized as red. If it is between 7-9 and 1-5 respectivly it is catagorized as blue.
