About: This is a library of general neural network structures that are trained through either evolution (generating slightly different copies of the same neural network and selecting the models that perform the best as the next generation) or backpropagation (a method of finding the optimal changes to make to the neural network using calculus) and can easily be implemented in other projects to simulate decision making and learning. 

About neural networks: A general neural network takes in inputs and runs it through the hidden layers
